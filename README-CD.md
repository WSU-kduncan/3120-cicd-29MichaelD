## Project 5

## Part 1
- In this part we are using semantic versioning to keep older versions of images so that if an image doesnt work with certain hardware or software, you can roll back to an older version
- To generate a tag in github command "git tag -a "v*.*.*""
- The workflow is triggered when a new tag is pushed to github, it will push that tag to github as well as pushing the new version of the image to dockerHub
